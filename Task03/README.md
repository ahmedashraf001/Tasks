# Task03

Define a base class called **Shape** with an abstract method **CalculateArea()**. Implement two derived classes, **Rectangle** and **Circle**, inheriting from **Shape**. Override the **CalculateArea()** method in each derived class to calculate the area of the corresponding shape. Write a program that demonstrates polymorphism by calling the **CalculateArea()** method on objects of both derived classes.
